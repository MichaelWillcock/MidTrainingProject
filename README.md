# MidTrainingProject
The project is to build a 3 tier application involving a database, business layer and gui.

## Sprint 1

I started by creating the project backlog seen here

#### Sprint Goals From Project Backlog
Epic - Create a framework for the application
User Story - As a creator I want to create a base framework for the application to use
- [x] 1.1 Given that I will need to see how the tables in the database interact with each other, when I got to create the database I will need to reference an entity relationship diagram.
- [x] 1.2 Given that I will need to create a database that'll need to be updated along the way, when I've finished my erd then I'll create a model first database for use in my application.
- [x] 1.3 Given I will need to have an understanding of my application, when I go to create the wpf gui application then I will need to have created wireframes to reference when creating my application.
- [x] 1.4 Given that I have created wireframes when I go to create the application I will need a base wpf file to use during the creation of the app.
- [x] 1.5 Given that I want my application to reference the database, when I have created the database and gui then I will need to create a business layer.
- [x] 1.6 Given that I want to test my applciation, when I have testable methods then I shall need a test file in which to write unit tests.


This was to gain an idea of all the work I would have to do in order to meet the projects definition of done, which was also detailed in the project backlog
(Insert screenshot of definition of done on kanban board)
Once this was completed I started working on setting up the framework that I would need later on in the project to create the application. This was detailed in the project backlog.
I started by creating the entity relationship diagram for my database

I then used this to create by database using the code first approach so that I can update the database later on if needed.
I then moved on to creating wireframes to get a better idea of what I would be creating upon using wpf
