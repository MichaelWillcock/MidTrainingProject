# MidTrainingProject
The project is to build a 3 tier application involving a database, business layer and gui.

## Sprint 1

I started by creating the project backlog seen here

This was to gain an idea of all the work I would have to do in order to meet the projects definition of done, which was also detailed in the project backlog
(Insert screenshot of definition of done on kanban board)
Once this was completed I started working on setting up the framework that I would need later on in the project to create the application. This was detailed in the project backlog.
I started by creating the entity relationship diagram for my database

I then used this to create by database using the code first approach so that I can update the database later on if needed

I then moved on to creating wireframes to get a better idea of what I would be creating upon using wpf
